Given an array of integers =citations= where =citations[i]= is the number of citations a researcher received for their =i=^{=th=} paper, return /the researcher's h-index/.

According to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index][definition of h-index on Wikipedia]]: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of =h= such that the given researcher has published at least =h= papers that have each been cited at least =h= times.



*Example 1:*

#+begin_example
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

*Example 2:*

#+begin_example
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
#+end_example



*Constraints:*

- =n == citations.length=
- =1 <= n <= 5000=
- =0 <= citations[i] <= 1000=

  #+begin_src ruby
def h_index(citations)
  citations.sort!.reverse!
  citations.each_with_index { |c, i| return i if c < i + 1 }
  citations.size
end

  #+end_src
