def getMaximumEatenDishCount(N: int, D: list[int], K: int) -> int:
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the last eaten position of each dish The code
    # is a function that takes three parameters: N (the total number of dishes), D (a
    # list of dishes), and K (the maximum difference allowed between the current and
    # last eaten position of a dish). The function returns the maximum count of dishes
    # that can be eaten.

    # The code uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the last eaten position
    # of each dish. It iterates through the list of dishes, checks if the current dish
    # is not in the window dictionary or if the difference between the current eaten
    # position and the last eaten position of the dish is greater than K. If either
    # condition is true, it updates the last eaten position of the dish in the window
    # dictionary and increments the eaten_counter. Finally, it returns the total number
    # of dishes eaten.
    window = {}
    # Initialize a counter for the number of eaten dishes
    eaten_counter = 0

    # Iterate through each dish
    for i in range(N):
        # Check if the current dish is not in the window dictionary
        # or if the difference between the current eaten position and the last eaten position of the dish is greater than K
        if not D[i] in window or (eaten_counter - window[D[i]]) > K:
            # Update the last eaten position of the dish in the window dictionary
            window[D[i]] = eaten_counter
            # Increment the eaten_counter as a new dish is eaten
            eaten_counter += 1

    # Return the total number of dishes eaten
    return eaten_counter
