There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array =points= where =points[i] = [x=_{=start=}=, x=_{=end=}=]= denotes a balloon whose *horizontal diameter* stretches between =x=_{=start=} and =x=_{=end=}. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up *directly vertically* (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with =x=_{=start=} and =x=_{=end=} is *burst* by an arrow shot at =x= if =x=_{=start=}= <= x <= x=_{=end=}. There is *no limit* to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array =points=, return /the *minimum* number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons/.



*Example 1:*

#+begin_example
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
#+end_example

*Example 2:*

#+begin_example
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
#+end_example

*Example 3:*

#+begin_example
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
#+end_example



*Constraints:*

- =1 <= points.length <= 10=^{=5=}
- =points[i].length == 2=
- =-2=^{=31=}= <= x=_{=start=}= < x=_{=end=}= <= 2=^{=31=}= - 1=

  #+begin_src ruby
def min_arrows(points)
  return 0 if points.empty?
  points.sort_by! { |p| p[1] }
  arrows = 1
  current_end = points[0][1]
  points.each do |point|
    if point[0] > current_end
      arrows += 1
      current_end = point[1]
    end
  end
  arrows
end
